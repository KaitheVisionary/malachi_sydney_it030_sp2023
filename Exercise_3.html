<h2>Read more about eggs</h2>

<p>Mankind has used eggs for at least five thousand years. It is known for sure that ostrich
eggs were fried by fire in ancient Egypt. The Romans used fried eggs as a dessert with
honey. The ancestors of the populace of modern Iran mixed the yolk with milk and
spices, and the French, in the middle of the seventeenth century, came to call it an
omelet. It was the French who perfected this dish by adding mushrooms, fresh vegetables,
and grated cheese.</p>
