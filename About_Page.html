  	<h2>Kai Photoproductions Quotes of motivation <h2>

<p>
"When words become unclear, I shall focus with photographs. When images become inadequate, I shall be content with silence."
"Photography is a way of feeling, of touching, of loving. What you have caught on film is captured forever… It remembers little things, long after you have forgotten everything."
"It’s one thing to make a picture of what a person looks like, it’s another thing to make a portrait of who they are."
"The best thing about a picture is that it never changes, even when the people in it do."
