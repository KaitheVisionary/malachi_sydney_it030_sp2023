  	<h2>Kai Photoproductions Quotes of motivation <h2>

<p>
"When words become unclear, I shall focus with photographs. When images become inadequate, I shall be content with silence."
<br>"Photography is a way of feeling, of touching, of loving. What you have caught on film is captured forever… It remembers little things, long after you have forgotten everything."

<br>"It’s one thing to make a picture of what a person looks like, it’s another thing to make a portrait of who they are."

<br>"The best thing about a picture is that it never changes, even when the people in it do."

<br>“We cannot solve problems with the kind of thinking we employed when we came up with them.”

<br>“It is only when we take chances, when our lives improve. The initial and the most difficult risk that we need to take is to become honest"

<br>"Success is not final; failure is not fatal: It is the courage to continue that counts."

<br>'Success is peace of mind, which is a direct result of self-satisfaction in knowing you made the effort to become the best of which you are capable.”
